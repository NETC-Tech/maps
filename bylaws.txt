<b>Article I – </b><b><i>Name</i></b>

<b>1.01 Name</b>

The name of this organization is the National Extension Technology Community. The acronym NETC is usually used when referring to the organization.

<b>Article II – </b><b><i>Purpose</i></b>

<b>2.01 Purpose</b>

NETC is a non-profit corporation and shall be operated exclusively for educational and charitable purposes within the meaning of Section 501 (c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or the corresponding section of any future Federal tax code.

NETC’s purpose is to ensure that Land Grant Institutions and other educational institution employees and volunteers have opportunities to learn and/or collaborate with colleagues from across the nation and globally. It may do this through an annual NETC Conference, mailing lists, web conferencing, or other valid technologies.

The NETC Conference is an annual event, usually hosted by any institution in the Extension System as defined by the United States Department of Agriculture, National Institute of Food and Agriculture, or subsequent federal organizations. Proposals to host will be given to the NETC steering committee, and the committee will decide who will host. Ideally, next year’s host will be chosen before this year’s conference. The NETC steering committee works with and assists the host institution as requested to ensure a successful conference.

<b>2.02 Distribution Upon Dissolution</b>

At the termination or dissolution of NETC, the allocation of resources will be determined based on the purpose of the breakup. If it is to make way for a new organization, then all assets shall be passed along to the new organization.

In all other cases, any monetary resources shall be split in half. The first half will be given back to the hosts of the previous three (3) NETC Conferences. The funds should be split evenly among these institutions. If an institution is not able to accept the funds, or declines to do so, their share will get distributed in the same method as the rest of the funds.

The rest of the funds will be given to one or more Section 501(c)(3) organization(s). The steering committee will decide on the appropriate organization(s). Ideally, the chosen organization(s) will promote the use of education and/or technology in underserved populations.

Should NETC hold any non-monetary assets, the steering committee will determine how to distribute them.

The President, Vice President, and Secretary are elected in a general election, i.e. any NETC member can vote. The regional member elections are open to members from the represented institutions.

Treasure will be elected by the steering committee, for a 3 year term.

Elections should be scheduled approximately 1 month before a conference. Voting should be open a minimum of 5 working days.

In the event that a member of the steering committee resigns, a special election can be held to fill the remaining term of that position. The steering committee will determine whether the special election should take place.

The steering committee can call other special elections if needed, such as to fill the positions on the initial committee.

For the member representing the past, current, and future NETC Conferences, they will have a 2-3 year term. Their term begins at the start of the NETC Conference prior to when they host, and ends at the end of the conference the year after they hosted, or the beginning of the following conference. It will be up to the individual whether they want to serve that final year.

<b>4.04 Page Not Found</b>

Reserved for conference

<b>4.05 Liaisons</b>

The steering committee has the option of adding/removing liaisons to the committee at any time. The liaisons would be non-voting members of the committee. Their purpose would be to ensure that NETC maintains a good working relationship with other organizations.

<b>4.06 Meetings</b>

The steering committee will have a face-to-face meeting at every NETC Conference.

The President may call additional meetings as needed. These meetings will use whatever technology is appropriate for the meeting.

The President and/or the steering committee will decide for each meeting whether it is for steering committee members only, or open to all NETC members.

To be an official meeting, a quorum of the steering committee is required. The number of people to make a quorum is determined by the size of the steering committee. If the steering committee has the full 11 members, a quorum is 6. During the conference, when there are 12 members, a quorum is 7. When there are only 8 or 9 steering committee members, a quorum is 5.

<b>4.07 Voting During Meetings (not elections)</b>

Motions are made and seconded by a member of the steering committee. This is to ensure that at least some of the steering committee support any motion that is made.

Any NETC member can contribute to discussions, either before or after the motion is made. For open meetings, any NETC members can vote. For closed meetings, only steering committee members can vote, not regular members or liaisons.

Oral votes are OK. When it’s not obvious whether a motion passes or fails, a re-vote will be conducted, using a more verifiable method to be determined by the President.

<b>4.08 Transparency</b>

The steering committee will operate in a transparent way whenever/wherever possible. It is best to err on the side of transparency.

<b>4.09 Compensation for Steering Committee Service</b>

Serving on the steering committee is a voluntary action, no compensation will be made to the steering committee members. You may, however, put it on your professional vita.

<b>Article V – </b><b><i>Miscellaneous</i></b>

<b>5.01 Years without a NETC Conference</b>

The NETC Conference is a huge reason for the existence of the NETC organization, so we hope there is a conference every year. However, many of the dates in the bylaws are based on the conference, so this is what happens in a year where there isn’t a conference.
<ol>
	<li>The membership would begin/end July 1. Members would need to pay dues in order to maintain membership. The steering committee will determine the amount for membership contribution.</li>
	<li>The size for the steering committee will decrease because there won’t be a member for the current conference. It will increase again when we have the full compliment of past, current, and future NETC conference host members.</li>
	<li>The terms of the steering committee would be extended an additional year.</li>
	<li>The steering committee will meet sometime during Spring or Summer. This meeting can be, but does not have to be, a face-to-face meeting. Treasurer and Secretary reports will be read.</li>
</ol>
<b>5.02 Reports</b>

The treasurer and secretary will give complete reports at the face-to-face meeting during the NETC Conference, and will give updates at other meetings as appropriate.

<b>5.03 Fiscal Year</b>

The fiscal year shall be January 1 to December 31 of each year.

<b>5.04 Committees</b>

There are no standing committees for the organization. The steering committee may put together committees to work on recommendations and/or other projects. Any NETC member can be on one of these committees, as well as non-NETC members where appropriate. No more than 33% of a committee can be non-members.

<b>5.05 Standard Operating Procedures</b>

In addition to bylaws, NETC can have a set of standard operating procedures (SOP). These SOP’s are publicly available documents that talk about the day to day operations of NETC. The SOP’s can be changed with a meeting of the steering committee.

When a SOP is created or modified, the Secretary will notify the current NETC members of the change.

( These could include how we decide who holds a conference if two institutions express interest, how we support the upcoming conference, how much money we try to maintain in reserve, and if we decide to do some sort of scholarship program, how it works.)

<b>5.06 Amending of Bylaws</b>

The steering committee shall review the bylaws annually, and may make proposed changes to the bylaws. When finished, the steering committee shall clearly communicate the changes to all NETC members. Members can then comment on the proposed changes, and the steering committee can use these comments to make additional changes. Each draft shall have the opportunity for comments.

Once there is a final draft, with no further changes after the comment period, there shall be a vote on the changes. This vote shall be open to all NETC members.
